Blockchain Internship Assignment
Objective:
Develop a script to generate a Merkle root from a list of transactions, construct a block using specified attributes, mine the block by finding a valid nonce, and verify the block's validity.

Instructions:

Generate Merkle Root:

You will be given a list of transactions.
Create a function to generate the Merkle root from these transactions.

Construct the Block:

Use the generated Merkle root and given attributes to construct a block.
The block should include:
Previous block hash
Merkle root
Target value
Nonce (initially set to 0)

Mine the Block:

Implement a function to mine the block by finding a valid nonce.
The block is considered mined when its hash is less than the target value.

Verify the Block:

Implement a function to verify the block's validity.
The block should be verified if:
The block hash meets the target.
The block hash is correctly calculated using the block attributes.



Provided Data:

Transactions:

transactions = [
    "tx1: Alice -> Bob: 10",
    "tx2: Bob -> Charlie: 5",
    "tx3: Charlie -> Dave: 3",
    "tx4: Dave -> Alice: 1"
]

Previous Block Hash:

previous_block_hash = "0000000000000000000767f1a45e8d64c90f40a3b4e6e9a0d2b7f5e6bc22fbe5"



Target:

target = "00000fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff"

Deliverables:

Script:

The script should include the following functions:
generate_merkle_root(transactions)
calculate_hash()
mine_block()
verify_block(block)


Output:

Print the Merkle root.
Print the block hash and nonce after mining.
Print the result of block verification.

Evaluation:

Correct implementation of the Merkle root generation.
Proper block construction and mining.
Accurate block verification.
Code readability and comments
